Crop Wars 2012
==============

Rules
-----
1. Chop one of the following images into 1000 equally sized images that comprise
   entire image, 24 times. This should result in 24,000 images.
       - [image.bmp](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37082018/image.bmp)
       - [image.tiff](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/37082018/image.tiff)
2. You MUST reload the image 24 times in order to simulate processing 24 unique
   images. No caching here.
3. Can be written in any reasonable language. If you want to utilize CUDA,
   OpenCL or write LOLCODE, go for it. It simply has to work and be fast.
   Feel free to use any third party libraries along the way.
4. Must run on a single machine - no cloud solutions. Code will be
   tested on a MacBook with a 2.2 GHz Intel Core i7 and 8 GB of RAM.
5. No rediculous hacks or bending rule #1 - this must be something that could
   (with some work, obviously) be used in production.
6. Make your submissions via pull request.

1. Chris (Java, 32s) -- INTENTIONALLY CHEATING!!! Rules don't specify crop size
                        Almost 99.95% of the time is spent on disk I/O, so 
                        biggest speedup is to just output small image :P
